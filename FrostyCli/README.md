# Usage

## Overview
> [!NOTE]

```
Description:
  CLI app to load and mod games made with the Frostbite Engine.

Usage:
  FrostyCli [command] [options]

Options:
  --version       Show version information
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  load <game-path>                                  Load a games data from the cache or create it.
  mod <game-path> <mods-dir>                        Generates a ModData folder, which can be used to mod the game.

## Interactive mode
Using the interactive CLI mode:
```bash
$ ./FrostyCli
```
Example clip using the interactive mode to generate mod data:


![Frosty CLI Interactive Mode](https://github.com/FrostyToolsuite/FrostyToolsuite/tree/master/Resources/FrostyCLIDemo.gif)



After generating a mod data folder, pass the datapath argument to the games launch options to apply the mods as such:

```-dataPath "<mod data path>"```
the dataPath argument takes either absolute paths or paths relative to the games directory, so for example if your mod data folder is in the games folder, it'd look like:
```-dataPath "Moddata"```

Or as an alternative to the datapath launch command, you can use the `GAME_DATA_DIR` environment variable instead as such:

```GAME_DATA_DIR=<mod data path>```


> [!NOTE]
> Games of Frostbite version above 2014.4.11 require the following steps (check version in the games json file in the Profiles folder) 

### On Linux
Please copy the bcrypt.dll file from the ThirdParty folder and paste it into the games files, and add the wine DLL override before the datapath command as such:
```WINEDLLOVERRIDES="bcrypt=n,b" %command% -datapath '<mod data path>'```

### On Windows
For Windows users, please copy the CryptBase.dll file from the ThirdParty folder and paste it into the games files.
